# Google Colab Notebooks

We've made some of our examples available as Google Colab notebooks. These notebooks are a great way to get started with CausaDB and see how it can be used to solve real-world problems.

You'll need an API key to get started, which you can get by sending an email to [info@causa.tech](mailto:info@causa.tech).
