# Introduction

Learn about CausaDB in a few minutes.

## Why do I need causal AI?

Standard AI algorithms are pattern-matching engines that are great at finding patterns in data, but they have no concept of cause-and-effect. This is a major problem when we try to use standard AI models (LLMs, neural nets, XGBoost, etc) to inform decision-making. Without understanding causation, these other algorithms confuse correlation for causation and can make inefficient and at worst damaging recommendations. 

Causal AI models are built from the ground up to capture causal structures. This gives them an understanding of cause-and-effect, so they can be trusted to make data-driven decisions. CausaDB is a platform to make it easy to get causal AI models out of the lab and into production.

## What is CausalOps?

CausalOps is an extension of the concept of MLOps to causal AI models. Standard MLOps practices alone aren't enough for productionising causal AI models, so CausalOps bridges the gap to make it simpler to build and maintain causal workflows. CausaDB is the only platform that makes CausalOps as easy as a few lines of code.
