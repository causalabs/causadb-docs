# Organisations

CausaDB access is managed through organisations. An organisation is a group of users that share access to the same data and models. Billing is also handled at the organisation level.

Access tokens (those beginning with `cdb_`) are associated with an organisation. When you create a new organisation, you will be given an access token that you can use to access the CausaDB API. Multiple tokens can be generated for a single organisation, and they can be revoked at any time. We recommend using a new token for each application or service that accesses CausaDB. Personal access tokens are also available for individual users.

Organisation and token management are currently handled through the support team. Please contact us at [causadb@causa.tech](mailto:causadb@causa.tech) to create a new organisation or request a new token.

:::note

Additional organisation management features are in development and will be available soon. These features will allow you to manage your organisation, users, and tokens through a web interface.
