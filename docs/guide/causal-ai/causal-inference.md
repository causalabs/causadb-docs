# Causal Inference

Causal inference is the process of determining the causal effect of one variable on another. This is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning, and it is essential for making decisions based on data. Causal inference has been used in academic research for many years, but it is now becoming increasingly important in industry as well. However, much of the existing tooling for causal inference is highly technical and difficult to understand for non-experts. Furthermore, many of the existing tools are focused on *inferring* causal relationships rather than *estimating* the outcomes of actions, which is critical for decision-making. 

CausaDB is designed to make causal inference accessible to everyone, by providing a simple and intuitive interface for estimating causal effects and making data-driven decisions. It also goes beyond the limitations of traditional causal inference methods by allowing users to simulate the effects of actions, optimise decisions based on causal models, and explain how AI models make decisions.
