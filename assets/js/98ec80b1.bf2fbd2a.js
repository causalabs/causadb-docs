This is a major problem when we try to use standard AI models (LLMs, neural nets, XGBoost, etc) to inform decision-making. Without understanding cause and effect, these other algorithms confuse correlation for causation and can make inefficient and at worst damaging recommendations. Importantly, because standard AI creates its own world-model based on correlations, it often fails when deployed in the real world, while causal AI works in deployment.
