customer intent","description":"In the competitive retail landscape, understanding customer intent and optimising discount strategies can have a large impact on profitability. This use case explores how CausaDB can be used to predict whether or not to offer a discount to a specific user, based on their viewing and buying history.","sidebar":"exampleSidebar"},"examples/use-cases/lifestyle":{"id":"examples/use-cases/lifestyle","title":"Recommending health and lifestyle interventions","description":"The availability of big data and the advancement of machine learning technologies has promised a revolution in personalised healthcare. ML and AI technologies could help to personalise treatments and recommendations to a person\'s specific needs. This technology has started to be used in both clinical and non-clinical settings, with popular apps helping people to manage their nutrition in a way that is tailor-made to their own needs. However a major limitation of these technologies is that they are rarely built using causally-aware algorithms. This makes it easy for AI algorithms to give poor and even potentially harmful recommendations. In this use case we\'ll explore how conventional AI gets this wrong, and how causal AI can be used to give trustworthy lifestyle recommendations.","sidebar":"exampleSidebar"},"examples/use-cases/supply_chain":{"id":"examples/use-cases/supply_chain","title":"Supply chain optimisation","description":"The use of AI in supply chain management, specifically for demand prediction, has become increasingly vital for retailers seeking to optimize their inventory and resources. Traditional predictive models have limitations, particularly in their ability to forecast over extended time horizons. This is due to their inability to account for dynamic relationships between variables such as seasonality and temperature. Here, we introduce a use case leveraging causal AI to address these challenges, demonstrating its potential in supply chain optimisation.","sidebar":"exampleSidebar"},"guide/getting-started/installation":{"id":"guide/getting-started/installation","title":"Installation","description":"CLI/Python interface","sidebar":"guideSidebar"},"guide/getting-started/intro":{"id":"guide/getting-started/intro","title":"Introduction","description":"Learn about CausaDB in a few minutes.","sidebar":"guideSidebar"},"guide/getting-started/quickstart":{"id":"guide/getting-started/quickstart","title":"Quickstart (Node.js)","description":"To get up and running quickly with CausaDB using Node.js, follow the steps below.","sidebar":"guideSidebar"},"reference/cli-reference/db-add":{"id":"reference/cli-reference/db-add","title":"Link a database","description":"\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Documentation is still under development.
